# {{ page.title }}

This is a website for information on Git development. If you
stumbled into this by mistake, you may want:

  - <http://git-scm.com>, which has information on running
    Git and links to download the latest version

  - <http://git.wiki.kernel.org>, the wiki that has historically
    contained developer information

These pages are intended to collect information useful to Git
developers. This is also the web home of:

  - the [Git Rev News newsletter](https://git.github.io/rev_news/),
  - the [involvement of the Git project in mentoring programs](https://git.github.io/General-Application-Information/)
    like [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) and the
    [GSoC (Google Summer of Code)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)

These pages are intended to be edited collaboratively (i.e., it is an
alternative to us having a wiki, but one that is edited entirely via Git
pushes).
